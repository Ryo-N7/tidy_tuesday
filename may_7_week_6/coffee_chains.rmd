## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(sf)
library(purrr)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }

coffee_df_raw <- data_frame(sheet = c(1, 2, 3)) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(sheet, 
                    function(x) {read_excel("../may_7_week_6/week6_coffee_chains.xlsx", sheet = x)
                    })
  )



```

cartograms :: `nc_cartogram()` >>> by number of each coffee chain!

color gradients for Starbucks (shades of green), Tim Horton's, Dunkin' Donuts
# >>> pull colors from logo?
